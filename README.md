# Image-Classification-using-ANN-and-CNN
ANN and CNN written in Keras to classify Cifar 10 image dataset.

# About Data set
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 photos divided into 10 classes (hence the name CIFAR-10). Classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats and so on. The dataset is split in a standard way, where 50,000 images are used for training a model and the remaining 10,000 for evaluating its performance.
The photos are in color with red, green and blue components, but are small measuring 32 by 32 pixel squares.

# About this repository
This repository contains ANN and CNN for classifying the Cifar-10 dataset and then compares their performance.

The Artificial Neural Network gives an accuracy of around 56% while the Convolutional Neural Network gives an accuracy of around 70%.

We can see a significant increase in accuracy when both models run for same epochs. Therefore we can easily say CNN works better for image classification.
